# Election-Analysis

## Project Overview
This report is an analysis of the results of a recent local congressional election, requested by the Colorado Board of Elections.

## Process
The process of preparing this report involved:
1. Calculating the total votes cast in the election.
2. Creating a complete list of the candidates who received votes.
3. Determining the total votes cast for each candidate.
4. Determining each candidate's percentage of the total votes cast.
5. Identifying the winner of the race, based on the popular vote.

## Resources
The dataset: election_results.csv

Software used in this analysis: Python, VS Code

## Summary of Findings
Through this analysis, we determined:
* **The total votes cast in the election:** 369,711
* **List of candidates who received votes:**
  * Charles Casper Stockham
  * Diana DeGette
  * Raymon Anthony Doane
* **Breakdown of votes by candidate:**
  * Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)
  * Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)
  * Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606)
* **Election winner:**
  * Diana DeGette won the election with 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 votes in total.

## Project Conclusion
By using Python and VS Code, we were able to quickly parse the 369,712-line data file and determine all the requested information quickly and with much less effort than such analysis would require in Excel. These tools offer greater computational efficiency and more complex analysis, which make them invaluable for a modern data analyst. 
In working on this project, I have gained a greater understanding of Python and practiced proper formatting and creating an easily-readable script using comments. I also learned more about the robust array of analytical tools, like the csv module, that are available in VS Code.
